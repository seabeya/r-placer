Official subreddit for the 'Reddit Place' event: [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/ 'r/place')

Here's how it works:

> You enter an image URL and starting points; the tool then displays the exact coordinates for each pixel, allowing you to click on any pixel to navigate to its corresponding location on the r/place canvas.

<br>

### How to use:

1. Go to https://r-placer.seabeya.com
2. **Enter an image URL**

   > You need an image URL that has been previously prepared and shared on image hosting platforms such as Imgur, Discord, etc.

   > To obtain the correct URL from such platforms, right-click and choose either "Copy image address" or "Open image in new tab" then copy the URL.

   > The image you are using should be pixel-perfect sized with the canvas. For example, you cannot use a 1600x1200 image to fit a 25x10 space.

3. **Enter the starting X & Y coordinates**
   > The top-left starting points for the image on the canvas.
4. **Click "generate"**
   > A new workspace URL will be created for you. When you follow the link, the workspace will be ready for placing the image you provided on the r/place canvas. Share the link with others to work together.
   >
   > Here is an example workspace link: https://r-placer.seabeya.com/workspace/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fr-placer.seabeya.com%2Ffavicon.ico&x=0&y=0
